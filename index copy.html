            This one required an extra element inside the content area (the ".push"), to ensure that the negative margin didn't pull 
            the footer up and cover any content. The push was also clever because it very likely didn't have any bottom margin of it's own.
            If it did, that would have to be factored into the negative margins, and having those two numbers not in sync doesn't look quite as nice.
            Notice the 70px in the calc() vs. the 50px fixed height of the footer. That's making an assumption. An assumption that the last
            item in the content has a bottom margin of 20px. It's that bottom margin plus the height of the footer that need to be added together 
            to subtract from the viewport height. And yeah, we're using viewport units here as another little trick to avoid having to set 100% body
            height before you can set 100% wrapper height.Notice the 70px in the calc() vs. the 50px fixed height of the footer. That's making an assumption. An assumption that the last
